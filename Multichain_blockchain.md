# Multichain blockchain
- It is a fork of Bitcoin.
- The difference between MultiChain and Bitcoin is that you can create your own
  private or permissioned network out of it.
- It does not allow you to add smart contract.
## Conclusion
We can't use this blockchain because it doesn't allow using smart-contracts.
